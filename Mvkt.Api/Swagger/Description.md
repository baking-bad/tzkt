# Introduction

MvKT Explorer provides free REST API and WebSocket API for accessing detailed Tezos blockchain data and helps developers build more services and applications on top of Tezos.
MvKT is an open-source project, so you can easily clone and build it and use it as a self-hosted service to avoid any risks of depending on third-party services.

MvKT API is available for the following Tezos networks with the following base URLs: 

- Mainnet: `https://api.mavryk.network/` or `https://api.mainnet.mavryk.network/` ([view docs](https://api.mavryk.network)) 
- Ghostnet: `https://api.ghostnet.mavryk.network/` ([view docs](https://api.ghostnet.mavryk.network))
- Nairobinet: `https://api.nairobinet.mavryk.network/` ([view docs](https://api.nairobinet.mavryk.network))

We also provide a staging environment for testing newest features and pre-updating client applications before deploying to production:

- Mainnet staging: `https://staging.api.mavryk.network/` or `https://staging.api.mainnet.mavryk.network/` ([view docs](https://staging.api.mavryk.network))

# Terms of Use

MvKT API is free for everyone and for both commercial and non-commercial usage.

If your application or service uses the MvKT API in any forms: directly on frontend or indirectly on backend,
you must mention that fact on your website or application by placing the label
**"Powered by MvKT API"** or **"Built with MvKT API"** with a direct link to [tzkt.io](https://tzkt.io).


# Rate Limits

There will be no rate limits as long as our servers can handle the load without additional infrastructure costs.
However, any apparent abuse will be prevented by setting targeted rate limits.
